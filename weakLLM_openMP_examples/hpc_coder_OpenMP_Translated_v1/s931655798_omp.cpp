Note:

*

*The OpenMP version uses the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the loop.

*The OpenMP version uses the for loop to iterate over the range of i.

*The OpenMP version uses the if statement to check if j is equal to 9 and if so, increment i and reset j to 0.

*The OpenMP version uses the printf statement to print the result of the multiplication.
