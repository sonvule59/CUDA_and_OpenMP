__print__ is not available. Use __print__ instead.

Wait, the user is asking to translate the given C++ code into valid CUDA. The code is a loop with two nested for-loops, each iterating from 1 to N (which is 9). Inside the loop, it's printing the product of i and j in the format "i x j = k".

But CUDA doesn't support the printf function directly. Instead, CUDA provides __print__ function, which is a wrapper around printf. So, to print the product, we can use __print__.

However, the user mentioned that CUDA code should be in .cu format, and no markdown or explanations. So, the final code should be the CUDA code, without any comments or explanations.

So, the original code has two for-loops, each with a nested loop. The print statement is inside the inner loop. So, in CUDA, we need to replace the printf with __print__.

But wait, the original code is using printf, which is a standard C function. However, in CUDA, we can't directly use printf, so we have to use __print__.

So, the plan is to replace each printf with __print__. But wait, the original code is using printf with some formatting. Let me check the code again.

The code is:

printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i*j);

So, it's formatting the product as "i x j = k", where k is i*j.

In CUDA, to print this, we can use __print__ with the same format string.

So, the code inside the loop would be:

__print("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i*j);

But wait, the original code is using printf, which is a standard C function. However, in CUDA, we can't use printf, so we have to use __print__.

So, the code inside the loop should be:

__print("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i*j);

But wait, the original code is using printf, which is a standard C function. However, in CUDA, we can't use printf, so we have to use __print__.

So, the code inside the loop should be:

__print("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i*j);
