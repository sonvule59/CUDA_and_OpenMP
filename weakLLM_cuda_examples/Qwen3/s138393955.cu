The code is not valid. Why?

The problem is that the C++ code has a loop that iterates over i and j, and for each iteration, it prints the value of n1 and n2. However, the CUDA code is written in a way that the loop is not properly translated. The problem is that the C++ code uses a for loop with two nested loops, but the CUDA code uses a single loop with two variables, n1 and n2, and a single printf statement. This is not the same as the C++ code, so the translation is not valid.
