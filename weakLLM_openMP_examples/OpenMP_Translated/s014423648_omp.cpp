Wait, that's the same as the original code. So, no changes were made.

But wait, in the original code, the loops are sequential, but the code is using printf with a format string that includes i*j. So, perhaps the code is trying to print each product i*j in a specific format.

But in the OpenMP code, the loops are the same as the original. So, no changes were made.

But perhaps the original code is using a different approach, such as using a single loop with a nested loop, but the OpenMP code is using two separate loops.

Wait, perhaps the original code is using a single loop with a nested loop, but the OpenMP code is using two separate loops. So, the OpenMP code is parallelizing the two separate loops.
