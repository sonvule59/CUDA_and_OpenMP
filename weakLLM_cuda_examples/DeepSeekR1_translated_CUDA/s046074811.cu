Okay, I need to translate the given C++ code into CUDA. Let me look at the code carefully. 

The code starts with some includes and constants. Then there's a loop with two nested loops, each running 10 times. Inside, it prints i multiplied by j. 

First, I notice that the code uses cout, which is a statement for output. But in CUDA, I don't want to use cout because it's not supported. So I'll need to find an alternative way to output the results. Maybe using a print function or logging mechanism. 

Next, the code initializes several variables like ans, sum, n, k, cnt, w, h, and a string s. These are all global variables. In CUDA, variables are stored in shared memory, so I'll need to declare them as shared. 

The vector declarations: vector<ll> v, vector<pair<ll, ll>> vp, etc. These are standard C++ vectors. In CUDA, I'll need to create shared memory for these vectors. 

The loop uses a nested loop structure. In CUDA, I can't directly translate loops like that, but I can use the __kernel__ and __global__ constructs. However, the main issue is handling the output. 

I'll need to replace the cout statements with a way to print to the console. Maybe using a stream or a logging library. Alternatively, I can use the CUDA print function, but I'm not sure if that's available. 

Wait, the user said to return only CUDA `.cu` code, no markdown or explanations. So I should focus on the CUDA code structure. 

I'll start by declaring the shared memory for the variables. For example, for ll ans, sum, n, etc., I'll create shared memory blocks. 

Then, the loops. Since CUDA loops are not straightforward, I'll use the __kernel__ and __global__ constructs. But the main issue is handling the output. 

I'll need to create a kernel that runs on all CUDA devices. The kernel will have a loop for i and j, compute i*j, and print it. 

But how to print in CUDA? Maybe using the print function from the CUDA runtime. Alternatively, I can use a logging library, but that might complicate things. 

Alternatively, I can use the standard output by creating a stream. But in CUDA, the
