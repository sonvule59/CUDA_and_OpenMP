Explanation:
- The original C++ code defines two nested loops that iterate over a range of values for `n` and `p`. It prints the product of `p` and `n` for each value of `n` within the loop.
- In the CUDA code, we define a kernel function `kernel` which takes three arguments: `p`, `n`, and an array `result` to store the product of `p` and `n`.
- Inside the kernel function, we use the `threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x` indexing to determine the current thread's location within the grid and the block size.
- If the thread ID is less than `n`, it means it has reached the end of the inner loop, so we assign the product of `p` and `n` to the corresponding element in the `result` array using the `result[thread_id] = p * n` statement.
- We then initialize a shared memory block `shared_result` with a size of 10 (`shared_memory_block[n]`) to store the result.
- In the `main` function, we declare a global variable `n` and a local variable `p` to represent the number of elements and the starting element respectively.
- We also declare a global variable `global_result` as a pointer to the shared memory block `shared_result` and initialize it to point to the first element of the block.
- We create a shared memory block `shared_result` using the `shared_memory_block[n]` expression and pass it to the kernel function along with the `n` and `p
