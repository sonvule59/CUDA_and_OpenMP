The code is not valid. Why?

The problem is that the CUDA code has a syntax error in the for loops. The for loops are not properly translated to CUDA. The first for loop in the C++ code is for i in 1 to 9, and the second for j in 1 to 9. However, in CUDA, the for loops are not translated directly. The first for loop in the C++ code is translated to a for loop in the CUDA code, but the second for loop is translated to a for loop in the CUDA code. However, the syntax is not correct. The first for loop in the C++ code is translated to a for loop in the CUDA code, but the second for loop is translated to a for loop in the CUDA code. However, the syntax is not correct.
