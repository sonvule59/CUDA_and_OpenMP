To CUDA, the code should be:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int a=1,b=1;
	while(a<10&&b<10)
	{
		printf("%dx%d=%d\n",a,b,a*b);
		b++;
		if(b>9)
		{
			a++;
			b=1;
		}
	}
}
"

Wait, but in the original code, a and b are integers. In CUDA, integers are handled as 32-bit signed integers. So, when a or b exceeds 2^31-1, it will cause an overflow. But in the original code, a and b are only up to 9, so they won't overflow. So, no problem.

But wait, in the original code, a and b are being incremented beyond 9, but in the CUDA code, a and b are 32-bit signed integers. So, when a is 10, it's okay because 10 is less than 2^31-1. So, no problem.
