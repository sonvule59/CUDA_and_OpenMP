__kernel__ __attribute__(“__loop__”);

Wait, I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. I'm trying to translate the C++ code into OpenMP. The code is a double loop with i and j from 1 to 9. Each iteration prints i x j = k.

I need to make this code run in parallel using OpenMP. So, I should identify the loops that can be parallelized.

The outer loop is for i from 1 to 9. The inner loop is for j from 1 to 9. Each iteration of the inner loop is a printf statement.

In OpenMP, I can use the "parallel" keyword to parallelize the loops. But I'm not sure how to structure the OpenMP directives correctly.

Wait, the code is a double loop, so I can parallelize both loops. But in OpenMP, the loops are typically handled with "for" or "parallel" directives.

I think I should use the "parallel" keyword for the outer loop and then the inner loop can be parallelized within the same "parallel" block.

Alternatively, I can use the "parallel" keyword for both loops, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Wait, in OpenMP, the "parallel" keyword can be used to parallelize a loop, and the inner loop can be parallelized within the same "parallel" block.

So, the plan is:

1. OpenMP code starts with a kernel, but in this case, the kernel is not needed because it's a single program.

2. Use the "parallel" keyword for the outer loop.

3. Inside the "parallel" block, use another "for" loop for the inner loop.

4. Each iteration of the inner loop will execute the printf statement.

But wait, in OpenMP, the "parallel" keyword can be used for both the outer and inner loops, but the inner loop must be within the same "parallel" block.

So, the code would look like:

parallel
{
    for(i = 1; i <= 9; ++i)
        for(j = 1; j <= 9; ++j)
            printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
}

But wait, in OpenMP, the "parallel" keyword can be used for multiple loops, but each loop must be within a "parallel" block.

Alternatively, I can use the "parallel" keyword for the outer loop and then the inner loop can be parallelized within the same "parallel" block.

Wait, but in the original code, the loops are sequential. So, to parallelize, I need to wrap the inner loop in a "parallel" block.

So, the code would be:

parallel
{
    for(i = 1; i <= 9; ++i)
        for(j = 1; j <= 9; ++j)
            printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i * j);
}

Wait, no, the "parallel" keyword can be used for multiple loops, but each loop must be within a "parallel" block. So, the outer loop can be parallelized, and the inner loop can be parallelized within the same "parallel" block.

parallel
