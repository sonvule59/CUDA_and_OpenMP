__print__ is not defined. So, I need to implement the print function.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to implement this. Maybe I can write a helper function that prints the number of digits for each i and j.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write a kernel that loops through each i and j, computes the number of digits, and prints it.

But I'm not sure how to handle the digits computation in CUDA.

Wait, perhaps I can write a helper function that, given a number, returns the number of digits it has.

But in CUDA, functions can't be defined inside kernels. So, perhaps I can write a helper function outside the kernel, but in the same .cu file.

But in the given code, the main function uses printf, which is a standard C function. So, perhaps I can replace the printf with a CUDA-enabled print function.

But in CUDA, the print function is not available. So, perhaps I can write a custom print function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the __print__ function, but it's not defined in CUDA.
