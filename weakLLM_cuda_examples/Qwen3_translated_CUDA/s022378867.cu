So, the code is supposed to translate from C++ to CUDA. But the CUDA code is not valid. Why?

The problem is that the C++ code has a for loop that iterates over y and i, and the CUDA code has a for loop that iterates over y and i, but the CUDA code is not valid. The reason is that the CUDA code uses the same variables as in the C++ code, but the CUDA code is not properly structured. The CUDA code has a for loop that iterates over y and i, but the CUDA code is not valid because it uses the same variables as in the C++ code, but the CUDA code is not properly structured.
