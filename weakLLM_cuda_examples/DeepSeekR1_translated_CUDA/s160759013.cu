But wait, I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me think about the CUDA code.

Wait, I'm not sure if I'm using the correct CUDA syntax. For example, in the loop, I have for (int i = 1 ; i <= 9 ; i++), but in CUDA, loops are written with __for__ and __loop__ keywords. Also, I'm not sure if the variables are correctly handled in the CUDA context.

Another thing: I'm using cout and cout <<, which are not CUDA-enabled. So, I need to find a way to make these outputs CUDA-enabled. Maybe using a stream or something similar.

Wait, but in the original code, the output is a simple table. So, perhaps I can generate the output using CUDA's built-in functions or by writing to a file.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the CUDA Thrust library to output the data, but that might be overkill.

Wait, but in the original code, the output is a simple table. So, perhaps I can generate the data and then write it to a file, which is CUDA-enabled.

So, the plan is:

1. Replace the for loops with CUDA loops using __for__ and __loop__.

2. Replace the cout statements with CUDA-compatible output, perhaps using streams or writing to a file.

So, in the CUDA code, I can generate the data and then write it to a file.

But how to do that.

First, I need to generate the data. So, in the CUDA code, I can have a loop that iterates over i and x, computes i*x, and writes it to a file.

But in CUDA, writing to a file is possible using the CUDA Thrust library, but perhaps for simplicity, I can write to a text file.

So, the steps are:

- Replace the for loops with CUDA loops.

- Replace the cout statements with writing to a file.

But how to write to a file in CUDA.

In CUDA, writing to a file can be done using the CUDA Thrust library's write thrust file function, but perhaps for simplicity, I can
