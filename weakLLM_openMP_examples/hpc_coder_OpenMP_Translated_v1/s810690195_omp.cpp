The OpenMP code uses the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the loops. The directive tells the compiler to create a team of threads and distribute the iterations of the loop among them. The #pragma omp parallel for directive is used to parallelize the loops in the code. The directive is placed before the loop to be parallelized. The directive is followed by the loop to be parallelized. The directive is followed by the loop to be parallelized. The directive is followed by the loop to be parallelized. The directive is followed by the loop to be parallelized. The directive is followed by the loop to be parallelized.
