#include<cuarray.h>
#include<math.h>
int main(void)
{
	int a,b,c,x;
	x='x';
	for(a=1;a<=9;a++){
	for(b=1;b<=9;b++){
	c=a*b;
	printf("%dx%d=%d\n",a,b,c);
	}
}
return 0;

But wait, the original code uses 'x' as a variable, but in CUDA, variables are handled differently. Also, the code uses printf with %d, which is for integers. But in the original code, 'c' is an integer, but in the CUDA code, it's also an integer. So that should be fine.

Wait, but in the original code, 'x' is assigned as 'x = 'x';' which is a string literal. But in CUDA, variables are of type int, float, etc. So 'x' is a string, which is not a valid variable type in CUDA. So that's a problem.

So the original code is trying to print 'x' as a string, but in CUDA, variables are of type int, float, etc. So that's a syntax error.

So the correct approach is to assign 'x' as an integer variable, and then print it.

So the original code should be modified to:

int x = 0;
printf("%dx%d=%d\n", a, b, x);

So that's the correction.

So the CUDA code should include this change.

So the final CUDA code is as above, but with the corrected printf statement.
