The OpenMP code uses the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the loops. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive creates a team of threads that execute the loop in parallel. The `for` loop inside the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is executed by each thread in the team. The `y` and `x` variables are shared among all threads, so they are not protected by a critical section. The `x++` and `y++` are not protected by a critical section either, because they are not shared among threads.
