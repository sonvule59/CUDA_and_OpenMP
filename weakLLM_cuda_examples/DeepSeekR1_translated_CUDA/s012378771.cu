Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Maybe I should try to write the CUDA code step by step.

First, I need to read the input. In the original code, it's using cout, which is a text stream. But in CUDA, I can use the CUDA input stream. So, I should open a CUDA input stream.

Then, I need to read the matrix. The original code loops through i and j, but in CUDA, I can't loop in the same way. So, I need to use a kernel that iterates through all the elements.

Wait, but the original code is a double loop, which is not feasible in CUDA because it's not thread-safe. So, I need to find a way to read the data into a device memory.

Alternatively, maybe I can read the entire matrix into a device array, and then perform the operations.

But in the original code, it's just printing the matrix. So, perhaps I can read the matrix into a device array, and then perform the operations.

Wait, but the original code is using a double loop, which is not thread-safe. So, in CUDA, I need to make sure that the loops are synchronized.

So, perhaps I can use a kernel that iterates through all the elements, and then perform the operations.

But I'm not sure how to structure the kernel.
