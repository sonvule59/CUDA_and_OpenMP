__int64_t n,m; // n and m are unsigned 32-bit integers
int main() {
    __int64_t n,m;
    // ... rest of code ...
}

Wait, but the original code uses int n, m, which are 32-bit. The CUDA code uses __int64_t n, m, which is 64-bit. So, the data type is different. So, the code can't be directly translated.

But in the original code, n and m are unsigned 32-bit integers. So, in CUDA, we can't use __int64_t because it's a 64-bit type, but we can use __int32_t n, m. But wait, the original code uses int n, m, which are 32-bit. So, in CUDA, we can use __int32_t n, m.

But in the original code, n and m are unsigned, so they can be up to 2^32-1. So, in CUDA, we can use __int32_t n, m, which is 32-bit unsigned.

So, the code can be translated as:

#include <stdio.h>
__int32_t n, m;
int main() {
    // ... rest of code ...
}

But wait, in the original code, n and m are used in printf("%dx%d=%d\n",n,m,n*m); So, n and m are multiplied, which is an int operation. But in CUDA, when you have __int32_t variables, you have to cast them to int before performing the operation.

So, in the printf statement, n and m are being cast to int. So, in CUDA, we can cast them to int.

So, the code would be:

__int32_t n, m;
int main() {
    // ... rest of code ...
}

But wait, in the original code, n and m are used in a loop, and in the printf statement, they are multiplied. So, in CUDA, we need to cast __int32_t n and m to int before using them in the printf statement.

So, the code would be:

__int32_t n, m;
int main() {
    // ... rest of code ...
}

But wait, in the original code, n and m are used in a loop, and in the printf statement, they are multiplied. So, in CUDA, we
