I think the code is not valid. What is the problem?

The problem is that the C++ code is not valid. The problem is that the C++ code has a for loop that iterates over i and n, but the CUDA code uses a global pointer and a global index. The problem is that the C++ code is not using the same variables as the CUDA code. The problem is that the C++ code has a for loop with two nested loops, but the CUDA code uses a single loop with a global pointer and a global index.
