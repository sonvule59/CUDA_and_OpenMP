Wait, the user wants the code translated into valid CUDA, but only the CUDA .cu code, no markdown or explanations. So, I need to make sure that the code is properly formatted and only includes the CUDA code.

First, I notice that the original code uses cout, which is a C function. In CUDA, we don't have a direct equivalent for cout, so we need to use __FILE__ to include the header file. So, I'll add #include <iostream> and make sure it's included in the CUDA code.

Next, the main function in CUDA needs to be declared with __global__ or __local__. Since the original code is a loop, I'll use __global__ for the main function. Also, I need to declare the variables i and n as __cu__ to ensure they are treated as CUDA variables.

I should also make sure that the CUDA code includes the necessary headers, like __CUDA__ and __cu__, but since the user only wants the .cu code, I'll focus on that.

Putting it all together, I'll write the CUDA code with the necessary includes and variable declarations, and make sure the loops are correctly structured for CUDA.

I should also check if the code compiles without any issues, but since the user is asking for the translation, I'll assume that the code is correct and just needs formatting.

        for (int n = 1; n <= 9; n++) {
