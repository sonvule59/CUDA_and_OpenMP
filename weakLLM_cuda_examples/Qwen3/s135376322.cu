So, the user wants to translate the C++ code into CUDA. The C++ code is a simple loop that multiplies two arrays and prints the results. The CUDA code provided is a different version. The user is asking to translate the C++ code into valid CUDA, but the CUDA code seems to have syntax errors. The user also mentioned that the CUDA code is not valid. The user is confused and wants to know if the translation is correct.

The user's question is to translate the C++ code into valid CUDA. The provided CUDA code has syntax errors, such as missing semicolon, incorrect syntax for the for loops, and incorrect use of cudaMemcpy. The C++ code is a simple loop that multiplies two arrays and prints the results. The CUDA code is not valid, so the user is confused and wants to know if the translation is correct.
