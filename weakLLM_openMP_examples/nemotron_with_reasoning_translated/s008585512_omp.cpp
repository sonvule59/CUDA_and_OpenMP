please generate it with same functionality as given C++ code. Output only the code.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to convert a given C++ code to OpenMP code, focusing only on the parallelizable parts. The output should be the OpenMP code itself, without any extra text.

First, I need to understand what the original C++ code does. Let me read through it.

The code includes a lot of headers, which I can ignore since they're only for completeness. The main function creates a map (dictionary) called mp. Then there's a loop using rep(i,9) and rep(j,9), which are defined as loops from i=0 to 8 and j=0 to 8, respectively. Wait, no, the rep(i,9) is a range-based for loop that runs i from 0 to 8 (since n is 9). Similarly for j. So the nested loops are iterating i from 0 to 8 and j from 0 to 8. For each pair (i,j), they store the size of the map mp at index j + i*9 into itself. Then they print a line showing i+1 x j+1 = (i+1)*(j+1).

Wait, but in the code, inside the loop, they do mp[j + i*9] = (int)mp.size(). Wait, that's strange. Because j and i are both from 0 to 8. So j + i*9 would be values from 0 + 0*9=0 up to 8 +8*9=80. But the map mp is initially empty. So each iteration, they're setting mp[j + i*9] to the current size of the map. But since the map starts empty, the first time this is done, mp is empty, so mp.size() is 0, and each assignment would be overwriting previous entries. But this seems like a mistake. Because for each (i,j), j + i*9 is a unique key? Let's see: For i=0, j ranges 0-8: keys 0-8. For i=1, j ranges 0-8: keys 9-17. And so on. So each i corresponds to a block of 9 entries. But since the code is assigning mp[j + i*9] to the size of the map at that moment, which is being incremented each time? Wait, no. The map is initially empty. The first iteration (i=0, j=0) sets mp[0] = 0 (since mp.size() is 0). Then, when j increments, for i=0, j=1: mp[1] = 0 again, because the map is still empty. So all entries in the map would be 0. Then, when i=1, j=0: j + i*9 is 0 + 1*9 =9. mp[9] is set to 0. So all entries in the map are 0. Then, the code prints lines like 1x1=1, 1x2=2, etc., up to 9x9=81. But the actual map isn't being filled with any real data. So this code is just printing all pairs of numbers from 1 to 9 multiplied together. The loops are completely unnecessary because the output can be generated with a single loop. But maybe the original code is a placeholder or an example of some algorithm, but in reality, the loops are not needed. However, the user wants the OpenMP code to have the same functionality as the given C++ code. So even if the C++ code is inefficient, the OpenMP should replicate it.

But wait, the C++ code's loops are nested, with i from 0-8 and j from 0-8. So total 81 iterations. For each, it's doing mp[j + i*9] = (int)mp.size(). Since the map starts empty, every assignment here will set the key to 0. Then, when printing, it's outputting (i+1) x (j+1) = product. So the output is all pairs of numbers from 1 to 9 multiplied, which is 81 lines. So the actual code's logic is just a nested loop to print all combinations, but the map operations are redundant. But regardless, the task is to convert the parallel parts to OpenMP.

Now, looking at the loops in the C++ code. The code uses two nested for loops, both iterating over 9 elements. These are sequential loops. To parallelize them with OpenMP, we can use #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize one or both loops.

But the user wants the OpenMP code to have the same functionality. So the question is: which loops can be parallelized?

The original code has two nested loops. If we parallelize both, then each loop can be processed in parallel. However, the order of execution might not matter here since each iteration is independent. Each iteration writes to the map (which in reality does nothing useful, but the code is as given) and then prints a line. So the printing part could also be parallelized.

But in OpenMP, the default is that all iterations of a loop are processed sequentially unless specified. To parallelize the loops, we can use parallel for directives.

So for the outer loop (i), we can set #pragma omp parallel for and have each i iteration processed in parallel. Alternatively, parallelize the inner loop (j). Or both.

But since the loops are nested, perhaps the best approach is to parallelize both loops. So the outer loop runs in parallel for each i, and within each i, the inner loop runs sequentially. Or vice versa. Or both loops in parallel.

But OpenMP allows us to choose. Let's think: the code's body inside the loops is:

mp[j + i*9] = (int)mp.size(); // which does nothing useful, but in the original code.

cout << i+1 << 'x' << j+1 << '=' << (i+1)*(j+1) << endl;

So each (i,j) pair is processed, and a line is printed. The map assignment is redundant here, but the code is as given.

So to parallelize, the key is to split the loops into parallel sections.

Option 1: Parallelize the outer loop. So each i is processed in parallel. Then, for each i, the inner loop runs. But the inner loop is 9 iterations. Alternatively, parallelize the inner loop. Or both.

But since the code's output is order-dependent (it's printing in order of i from 1 to 9, and for each i, j from 1 to 9), the order of the output lines must be preserved. So if we parallelize the loops, the order of the printed lines might not be the same as the original code. However, in the original code, the loops are sequential, so the output is in order. If we parallelize, the lines might be printed out of order. But the user's code's output is fixed. So to maintain the same output order, we can't parallelize the loops in a way that changes the iteration order. However, OpenMP's default scheduling is a breadth-gather, which might not preserve order. But if the user's code requires the lines to be printed in order, then we need to ensure that the parallel threads execute in a way that the output is ordered correctly. However, that's complicated. But looking at the original code, the loops are strictly ordered, so the output is in the order of i from 0 to 8, j from 0 to 8. So each i iteration runs j from 0 to 8, and for each j, the line is printed. So the output order is i from 1 to 9, j from 1 to 9, in order.

If we parallelize the outer loop, then all i's are processed in parallel, but the inner loop for each i must be sequential to maintain the order of j. Because for a given i, the j's are printed in order. So if the outer loop is parallel, but the inner loop is sequential, then each i's j's are printed in order, but the i's can be processed in any order. That would mess up the output order. For example, i=0 and i=1 could be processed in parallel, leading to i=1's lines being printed before i=0's. Which is not desired.

Alternatively, if we parallelize the inner loop but keep the outer loop sequential. Then, for each i, the inner loop runs in parallel. But again, the j's would be processed out of order. For example, for i=0, j=0,1,...8. If the inner loop is parallel, j=0 could be processed after j=1, leading to output lines out of order.

Therefore, to maintain the same output order, the loops cannot be parallelized in a straightforward way. However, perhaps the code's output is such that the order doesn't matter. But according to the code's output, the lines are printed in order. So the user's code's output must be preserved exactly.

This presents a problem. Because if we parallelize the loops, the order of the printed lines might not be the same as the original code. However, the original code's output is in a specific order. So the OpenMP code must produce the same output in the same order.

In that case, parallelizing the loops would not be possible unless the threads are coordinated to print in order, which is complex. But perhaps the user's code is just an example, and the actual problem is to find parallel
