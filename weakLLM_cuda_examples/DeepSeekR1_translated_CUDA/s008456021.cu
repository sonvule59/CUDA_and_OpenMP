Please note that the above is just an example and you need to return only the CUDA code, no markdown or explanations.

To solve this problem, I need to translate the given C++ code into CUDA. The code is a simple nested loop that prints a multiplication table with some formatting. My task is to convert this into CUDA code, ensuring that it runs efficiently on a CUDA-enabled GPU.

First, I need to understand the structure of the original code. It's a double loop that iterates from 1 to 9 for both i and j. Inside the loop, it prints a string that includes the values of i and j, their product, and a newline character. The output is a formatted multiplication table.

Now, I need to think about how CUDA handles loops. Unlike C++, CUDA does not have a straightforward 'for' loop syntax. Instead, it uses the CUDA_C ublas library for linear algebra operations, but for simple loops, I can use the CUDA kernel programming model.

So, the plan is to create a CUDA kernel that performs the loop iterations and then execute it using CUDA's kernel execution functions. The kernel will handle the loop iterations, and the main function will manage the kernel's execution.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **Create a CUDA kernel**: This kernel will contain the loop body. The kernel needs to be able to handle the loop variables i and j, perform the multiplication, and output the formatted string.

2. **Define the kernel's work function**: The work function is where the loop iterations are executed. It will take the necessary parameters, such as the number of iterations, and the output stream.

3. **Set up the CUDA stream**: CUDA streams are used to control the execution of kernels. I'll need to create a stream, enqueue the kernel, and wait for it to execute.

4. **Initialize the output stream**: The output will be printed to a file, so I'll need to create a file handle and write to it.

5. **Execute the kernel**: Call the CUDA kernel's execute method to run the loop.

6. **Clean up**: After the kernel has finished, I'll need to clean up the CUDA stream and the output file to free up resources.

Now, let's think about the details.

**Kernel Definition**:

The kernel will have a work function that takes the number of iterations. Since the original code has two nested loops, the kernel will have a loop that runs for 9 iterations (for i) and, for each i, another
