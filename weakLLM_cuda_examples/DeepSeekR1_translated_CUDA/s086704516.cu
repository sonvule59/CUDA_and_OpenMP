But wait, the code is not using CUDA print. So, the output is just the regular print.

So, the code is correct as is.

But the user wants to translate the code into valid CUDA, but without any markdown or explanations.

So, the code is correct as is.

But the user wants to make sure that the code is properly translated into CUDA, and that the output is correct.
