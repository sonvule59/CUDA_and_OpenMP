Okay, so I need to translate this C++ code into CUDA. Let me see what the original code does. It's a double loop, right? For i from 0 to 8, and for n from 0 to 8, it calculates (n+1)*(i+1) and prints it in a specific format. So, it's generating a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 9.

Now, CUDA is all about parallel processing, so I need to find a way to make this loop run on the GPU. But wait, CUDA doesn't support loops directly. So, I need to find a way to convert this loop into something that can be executed in parallel.

Hmm, maybe I can use a kernel function. A kernel is a function that gets executed by each thread in the CUDA program. So, I need to write a kernel that can handle the computation for each (i, n) pair.

But how do I structure the kernel? I remember that in CUDA, each kernel has a grid of blocks and a block of threads. Each thread in the block can perform a specific task.

Wait, in this case, each thread would correspond to a pair (i, n). So, for each thread, I can compute the value (n+1)*(i+1) and then print it. But how do I handle the output? Because each thread would need to write to the same output stream, which is a problem because CUDA streams are per-thread.

Oh right, CUDA streams are per-thread, so I can't write to them directly. So, maybe I need to use a shared memory approach or a buffer to write to.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a kernel that writes to a global memory location. But that might complicate things.

Wait, another idea: since the output is a string that's printed to the console, maybe I can write each line to a file. But the original code uses std::cout, which is per-thread. So, writing to a file would require each thread to write to a different file, which isn't feasible.

Hmm, maybe I can use a buffer to write each line. But I'm not sure how to do that in CUDA.

Wait, perhaps I can use a kernel that writes each line to a global buffer. But I'm not sure how to set that up.
