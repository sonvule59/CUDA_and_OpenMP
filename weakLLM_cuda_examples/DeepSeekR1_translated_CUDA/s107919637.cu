Wait, the code is the same as the original, but it's not CUDA code. So, I need to modify it to work on CUDA.

Wait, but the original code is a simple loop that multiplies two integers and prints them. To make it work on CUDA, I need to make sure that the variables are properly handled on the GPU.

But in the original code, 'a' is an int, which is the result of i*j. So, in CUDA, I need to make sure that 'a' is a CUDA integer type, like int32_t or int64_t.

Wait, but in the original code, 'a' is an int, which is being assigned to cout. So, in CUDA, I need to make sure that 'a' is a CUDA integer type.

So, perhaps I should change 'a' to be a CUDA integer type, like int32_t.

But in the original code, 'a' is being used in cout, which is a stream. So, perhaps I need to make 'a' a pointer or a local variable.

Wait, but in CUDA, variables are handled differently. So, perhaps I need to make 'a' a local variable on the GPU.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make 'a' a pointer to an int, but that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make 'a' a local variable in the CUDA kernel.

Wait, but the original code is a simple loop, so perhaps the kernel can be a simple loop that multiplies two integers and prints them.

But in CUDA, the kernel needs to have a specific structure. So, perhaps I can write a kernel that takes 'i' and 'j' as parameters, multiplies them, and prints the result.

But in the original code, the variables are on the host, so perhaps I need to make them local to the kernel.

Wait, but in CUDA, variables are passed as pointers, but in this case, the variables are integers, so perhaps I can make them local to the kernel.

So, perhaps I can write a kernel like this:

__kernel__ void multiply(int i
