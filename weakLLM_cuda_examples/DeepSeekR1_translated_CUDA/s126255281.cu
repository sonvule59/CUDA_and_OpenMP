__global__ << 0 << endl;

Wait, I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. Maybe I should try to think about the problem differently.

Okay, I need to write a CUDA program that reads two integers from standard input, multiplies them, and prints the result in the format "i x j = i * j".

First, I need to think about how to read the input. The user is providing two integers, each on a separate line. So, in CUDA, I can read each line into a separate integer variable.

But wait, in CUDA, each thread can read one line. So, I can have a kernel that reads two integers from the input stream.

Next, I need to compute the product of these two integers. Since CUDA doesn't support function calls directly, I'll have to compute it using a loop or a built-in function.

Wait, in C++, I can use the __builtin__ function to compute the product. So, something like i * j.

Then, I need to output the result in the specified format. CUDA's output functions can help with that.

So, putting it all together, the kernel will read the two integers, compute their product, and then output the result in the desired format.

I should also consider the data layout. Since the input is read line by line, each integer will be in a separate memory location. CUDA's kernel needs to handle this correctly.

Another thing to think about is the kernel's parameters. I need to specify the number of input streams, the number of output streams, and the block and grid sizes.

Wait, in this case, I have two input streams (for i and j) and one output stream (for the product). So, the kernel will read from two streams and write to one.

I should also make sure that the kernel is efficient and doesn't have any unnecessary computations or memory accesses.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Create a kernel that reads two integers from the input streams.
2. Compute the product of these integers.
3. Output the result in the specified format.

Now, considering the CUDA code structure, I'll need to write a kernel function that handles this.

I should also make sure that the kernel is correctly handling the data layout and that the output is written correctly.

Another thing to consider is the use of __global__ to indicate that the kernel is executed on the GPU. This is important for CUDA programming.

So, putting it all together, the CUDA code will have a kernel function that
