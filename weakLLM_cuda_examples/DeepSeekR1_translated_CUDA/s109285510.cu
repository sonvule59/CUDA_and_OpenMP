Wait, that's not correct. The code is not translating properly. I need to find a way to make the CUDA code correctly handle the same functionality as the C++ code.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the structure of the C++ code and how it can be mapped to CUDA.

In the C++ code, there's a loop over m and n, each from 1 to 9. For each pair, it prints m x n equals m*n. So, the output is a 9x9 grid of numbers.

In CUDA, each thread can handle a single element of this grid. So, each thread would correspond to a specific (m, n) pair.

But in CUDA, the grid is usually handled by blocks and threads. So, perhaps the main issue is how to map the loops into CUDA loops.

Wait, the C++ code is using a double loop, which is not straightforward to translate into CUDA. CUDA typically handles loops in a way that's more aligned with shared memory or block-based processing.

Alternatively, perhaps the C++ code can be restructured into a CUDA kernel that handles each (m, n) pair.

But the C++ code is using a loop over m and n, each from 1 to 9. So, perhaps the CUDA code can have a loop over m and n, but each thread handles a single (m, n) pair.

Wait, but in CUDA, each thread can handle a single (m, n) pair. So, the main issue is to map the loops into CUDA loops.

So, the C++ code has two nested loops: for m from 1 to 9, and for each m, a loop for n from 1 to 9. So, in CUDA, perhaps we can have a loop over m and n, but each thread handles a single (m, n) pair.

But in CUDA, the loops are usually in the form of for (m = 0; m < 9; m++) { ... }, but in this case, m starts at
