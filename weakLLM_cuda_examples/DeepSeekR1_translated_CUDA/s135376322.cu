__global__ int kake = 0;

for (int i=1; i<10; i++) {
	for (int j=1; j<10; j++) {
		__global__ int kake = 0;
		cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << kake << endl;
	}
}

Wait, but the code is not correct. The for loops are not properly translated into CUDA. The code is missing the proper CUDA syntax and structure. The code should be translated into CUDA, but the original code is in C++. So, the task is to translate the C++ code into CUDA, but the user wants only the CUDA `.cu` code, no markdown or explanations.

So, the user provided the C++ code, and the assistant translated it into CUDA, but the assistant's translation is incorrect. The assistant's translation is:

__global__ int kake = 0;

for (int i=1; i<10; i++) {
	for (int j=1; j<10; j++) {
		__global__ int kake = 0;
		cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << kake << endl;
	}
}

But the correct CUDA code should have the loops properly translated into CUDA, with proper CUDA syntax, and the variables should be handled correctly.

So, the correct CUDA code should have the loops translated into CUDA, with the variables properly initialized and handled.

In CUDA, the for loops are translated into CUDA kernel launches, with the number of blocks and threads.

So, the correct CUDA code would be:

__global__ void kernel() {
	for (int i=1; i<10; i++) {
		for (int j=1; j<10; j++) {
			__global__ int kake = 0;
			cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << kake << endl;
		}
	}
}

But wait, in CUDA, the kernel must have a function declaration, and the loop variables must be properly handled.

So, the correct CUDA code would be:

__global__ void kernel() {
	for (int i=1; i<10; i++) {
		for (int j=1; j<10; j++) {
			__global__ int kake = 0;
			cout << i << "x" << j << "=" << kake << endl;
