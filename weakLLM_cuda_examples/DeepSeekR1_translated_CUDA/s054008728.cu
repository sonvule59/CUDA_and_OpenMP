__ yours__ code here.

Please find the following code in the C++ code: 1. The first loop is a for loop with x from 1 to 9. 2. The second loop is a for loop with y from 1 to 9. 3. The code inside the loops is a cout statement that outputs x, "x", y, "=", x*y, followed by a newline.

So, the code is structured as two nested for loops, each running from 1 to 9, and for each iteration, it outputs a specific string to the console.

Now, the task is to translate this code into CUDA. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. It allows software to be developed for general purpose processors (GPGPUs) and particularly for use on GPUs. CUDA code is executed on the GPU, which can significantly speed up certain types of computations.

In this case, the original code is a simple loop that iterates over x and y, and for each pair, it prints a string to the console. Since this is a simple task, the CUDA code can be written using CUDA's built-in functions and directives.

The first step is to identify the CUDA syntax and functions that can be used to replicate the behavior of the original C++ code.

In CUDA, loops are handled using CUDA's built-in functions, such as CUDA::forEach, which can simplify the implementation of nested loops.

The main steps to translate the code are:

1. Replace the for loops with CUDA::forEach.
2. Use CUDA::getThreadingInfo() to get the current x and y values.
3. Use CUDA::getVariable() to get the current x and y values.
4. Use CUDA::getGlobalID() and CUDA::getLocalID() to get the indices of the current thread.
5. Use CUDA::getVariable() to get the current x and y values.
6. Use CUDA::getThreadIndex() to get the index of the current thread.
7. Use CUDA::getThreadIndex() to get the index of the current thread.
8. Use CUDA::getThreadIndex() to get the index of the current thread.
9. Use CUDA::getThreadIndex() to get the index of the current thread.
10. Use CUDA::getThreadIndex() to get the index of the current thread.
11. Use CUDA::getThreadIndex() to get the index of the current thread.
12.
