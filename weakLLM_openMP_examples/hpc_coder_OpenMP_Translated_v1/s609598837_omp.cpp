The OpenMP code uses the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the outer loop. This directive tells the compiler to create a team of threads and distribute the iterations of the loop among them. The `for` loop inside the parallel region is executed by each thread in the team. The `std::cout` statement is executed by each thread in the team, and the output is printed to the console.
