  int n[9] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++)

The OpenMP version uses the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the outer loop. The `for` loop inside the parallel region is executed in parallel by multiple threads. The `i` and `j` variables are private to each thread, so there is no need to use locks or synchronization mechanisms.
