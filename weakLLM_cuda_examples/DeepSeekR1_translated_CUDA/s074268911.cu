Wait, I'm getting confused. I need to translate this C++ code into CUDA, but I'm not sure how to handle the variables. Let me think step by step.

First, the code is a loop that runs from i=1 to i<10, which is 9 times. Inside the loop, it prints g*i and checks if i is 9. If so, it resets i to 0 and increments g. If g reaches 10, it breaks the loop.

But in CUDA, variables are handled differently. I think in CUDA, each thread has its own local variables, and the main program has its own variables. So, I need to map the C++ variables to CUDA variables.

Wait, the main program is using int variables, but in CUDA, variables are of type int, but they are stored in memory as pointers. So, I need to make sure that the variables are correctly passed from the main program to the CUDA code.

Looking at the main code, it's using for loops with i and g. So, in CUDA, I can't use for loops because each thread would have its own i and g. Instead, I need to use a kernel that iterates over all the threads and performs the necessary operations.

So, the first step is to create a kernel that handles the loop. The kernel will have a loop that runs for 9 iterations, similar to the main program.

In CUDA, the kernel function is called with a pointer to the buffer where the data will be stored. So, I'll need to create a buffer for g and i. Since g starts at 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, and i starts at 1 and resets to 0 when i is 9, I need to map this behavior into CUDA.

Wait, in the main code, when i is 9, it resets to 0 and increments g. So, in CUDA, each thread will have its own i and g. So, for each thread, when i is 9,
