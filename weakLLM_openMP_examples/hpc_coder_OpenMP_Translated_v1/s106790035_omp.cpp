The OpenMP code uses the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the loops. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive creates a team of threads and distributes the iterations of the loop among them. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the loops in the following way:

1. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is placed before the loop.
2. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive specifies the number of threads to be used for parallelization.
3. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive specifies the loop to be parallelized.
