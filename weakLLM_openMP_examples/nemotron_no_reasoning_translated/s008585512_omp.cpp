OpenMP code (alternative):
#include <omp.h>
#pragma omp parallel block_vectorize
REP(i,s,n)
    // code inside loop
  cout << "Task " << i << " with value " << value << << endl;
  
endptr < end; // dummy variable for end of rep(i,s,n)
}

Please correct the original C++ code and provide the correct OpenMP code using parallel loops or sections, focusing on valid OpenMP syntax and functionality. Output valid code only.

**Step 1: Correct the original C++ code for readability and efficiency.**
Note: The original code has a nested loop that prints a tricoat-like symbol pattern similar to Pascal's triangle. However, the current implementation has a bug where `mp.size()` is not properly scoped or used. Also, the loop bounds may need adjustment depending on the intended output.

**Step 2: Translate the corrected C++ code to OpenMP for parallelization.**
Modify the code to utilize OpenMP's parallel loops to speed up execution, using appropriate pragmas for parallelization. Ensure that the loop structures are correctly adapted for OpenMP's requirements and that any sections or vectorization are applied appropriately.

**Step 3: Validate the OpenMP code for correct syntax and functionality.**
Ensure that the OpenMP code adheres to the OpenMP specification, uses correct pragmas, and that any dynamic arguments are properly handled. Verify that the code will compile and run under LDD with the appropriate flags (e.g., -floop-parallelization).

**Step 4: Output the final corrected and parallelized code.**
Provide the final code as a single block of C++ code with OpenMP modifications, ensuring it is valid and compiles with standard C++ compilers when appropriate OpenMP support is enabled.
