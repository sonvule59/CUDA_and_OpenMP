Your code goes here
//================================================<think>
Okay, I need to translate the given C++ code into CUDA. Let me look at the code first. It's a main function with nested loops printing i*xj. The code is pretty straightforward, just two loops.

First, I notice that the code uses cout for output. In CUDA, I think the equivalent would be cout, but I should check if there's a better way. Oh, right, CUDA has a stream, so maybe using std::cout is okay, but perhaps using a CUDA stream would be more efficient. But for simplicity, I'll stick with std::cout.

Next, the loops are using a for loop with i and j. In CUDA, the loop structure is a bit different. I remember that CUDA loops are done with __for_each, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here. Alternatively, I can use a nested loop structure with CUDA's __global__ variable.

Wait, the original code uses a double loop with two for loops. In CUDA, I can replicate this with nested loops. So I'll need to declare two CUDA streams, one for each loop. The outer loop can be handled by a loop variable, say i, and the inner loop by j.

I should also consider the data types. The original code uses int i and int j, but in CUDA, variables are typically handled as pointers or pointers to pointers. Since the code is simple, I can use pointers to hold the values of i and j.

Another thing to note is that the output is printed to the standard output. In CUDA, I can use std::cout, but I should make sure that the CUDA stream is properly initialized. I'll need to create a CUDA stream and then use it to write to cout.

Putting it all together, I'll declare two CUDA streams, one for each loop. The outer loop will iterate over i, and for each i, the inner loop will iterate over j. For each pair (i, j), I'll compute the product and write it to the output stream.

I should also handle the case where the output stream is not initialized. CUDA streams need to be initialized before they can be used. So I'll make sure to initialize the output stream before writing to it.

Wait, the original code uses cout, which is a global stream. In CUDA, I can create a CUDA stream and then use it to write to cout. So I'll create a CUDAStreamPtr and then use it with std::cout.
