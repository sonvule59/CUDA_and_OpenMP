__global__ << 0 << endl;

Wait, that's not correct. Please think about the problem and your approach to solving it.

Okay, I need to translate this C++ code into CUDA. Let me first understand what the original code is doing.

The code is a double loop that iterates from 1 to 10 for both Num and SubNum. For each pair, it prints the product of Num and SubNum. So, it's generating a multiplication table from 1x1 up to 10x10.

Now, the challenge is to translate this into CUDA. CUDA is designed for parallel computing on GPUs, so I need to find a way to execute this loop in parallel.

First, I should consider how CUDA handles loops. CUDA uses __kernel__ to define the kernel function, and __global__ to specify the grid of threads. Each thread can handle a specific iteration of the loop.

But wait, in this case, the original code is a double loop, which is inherently sequential. Translating it into CUDA would require some form of parallelization. However, the double loop is inherently sequential, so it's challenging to parallelize without some form of vectorization or using shared data structures.

Another approach is to use shared memory. CUDA allows the use of shared memory to speed up data access, which can be useful for this kind of computation.

Let me think about how to structure the shared memory approach. Shared memory can be accessed by all threads in the kernel, which can help in parallelizing the computation.

So, the plan is:

1. Use shared memory to store the multiplication table data.
2. Each thread will read from the shared memory and write back to it.
3. The kernel will handle the computation of the product and the writing to the shared memory.

But wait, the original code is a double loop, which is inherently sequential. So, how can we parallelize it using shared memory?

Alternatively, perhaps we can vectorize the computation. CUDA supports vector operations using __vector__ and __vector_set__ functions. However, the original code is a simple double loop, so vectorization might not be straightforward.

Another idea is to use a kernel that handles the computation in a way that allows multiple threads to compute different parts of the table simultaneously.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to use shared memory to store the multiplication table and have each thread write to it. But the original code is a double loop, so each iteration is sequential. So, how can we make this
