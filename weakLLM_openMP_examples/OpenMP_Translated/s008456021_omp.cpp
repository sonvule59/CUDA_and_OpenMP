__kernel__ __attribute__("openmp: parallel region");

Wait, I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. I'm trying to translate the C++ code into OpenMP. The code is a double loop with i and j both running from 1 to 9. Each iteration outputs a line with i, x, j, and the product.

I need to make sure that the OpenMP loops are correctly structured. I remember that in OpenMP, the loops are enclosed within a parallel region, and each loop can be openmp: parallel or not.

I think the first loop is the outer loop over i, and the second is over j. So, I should have two separate loops, each enclosed in a parallel region.

Wait, but in the original C++ code, the inner loop (j) is inside the outer loop (i). So, in OpenMP, I can have two separate loops, each with their own parallel regions.

So, the structure would be:

for (i=1; i<=9; i++) {
  // OpenMP loop for i
  for (j=1; j<=9; j++) {
    // OpenMP loop for j
    cout << ... ;
  }
}

But in OpenMP, each loop can be openmp: parallel or not. So, perhaps I can have each loop openmp: parallel.

Alternatively, I can have each loop openmp: parallel, but that might not be necessary. But for clarity, perhaps it's better to have each loop openmp: parallel.

So, the code would look like:

for (i=1; i<=9; i++) {
  __kernel__ __attribute__("openmp: parallel region");
    for (j=1; j<=9; j++) {
      __kernel__ __attribute__("openmp: parallel region");
      cout << i << 'x' << j << '=' << i*j << '\n';
    }
  }
}

for (i=1; i<=9; i++) {
  __kernel__ __attribute__("openmp: parallel region");
    for (j=1; j<=9; j++) {
      __kernel__ __attribute__("openmp: parallel region");
      cout << ... ;
