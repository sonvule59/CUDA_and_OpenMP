Wait, but the original code is a loop that prints i*x j, which is i multiplied by j. So in the CUDA code, we need to compute i*j and print it. So the code I wrote should work.

But wait, in the original code, the output is i x j, which is i multiplied by j. So in the CUDA code, we need to compute i*j and print it.

So the code I wrote is correct.
