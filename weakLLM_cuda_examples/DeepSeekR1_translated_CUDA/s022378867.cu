The above code is a simple loop that prints y multiplied by i, for y and i from 1 to 9.

The user wants to translate this into CUDA, but the code provided is not correct. The user is asking to write the correct CUDA code that does the same thing.

The code should be in .cu format, only, no other stuff.

The code should compile and run correctly.

The code should output the same as the original, but using CUDA.

The code should be efficient, but not too slow.

The code should handle all the cases correctly, including when y and i are 1 to 9.

The code should not have any syntax errors, and should compile without issues.
