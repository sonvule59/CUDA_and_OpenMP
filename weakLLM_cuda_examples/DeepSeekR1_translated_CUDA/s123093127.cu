Your code should be a CUDA program that computes the same thing as the C++ code above. Return only the CUDA code, no markdown or explanations.

The code should be written in CUDA C++ standard, using the correct syntax for CUDA, including the use of 'static const double EPS = 1e-5;' and other necessary includes and definitions.
The code should be a self-contained CUDA program that can be compiled and run without any additional setup.
The code should compute the same thing as the C++ code above, which is a 9x9 matrix of printed (i+1)*(j+1) values.
