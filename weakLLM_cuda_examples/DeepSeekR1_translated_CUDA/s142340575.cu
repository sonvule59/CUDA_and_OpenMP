Okay, so I need to translate this C++ code into CUDA. Let me see. The original code is a double loop with printf statements. It's generating a 9x9 grid of numbers, each being the product of (i+1) and (j+1). 

First, I should think about how CUDA handles loops. CUDA uses shared memory for frequently accessed data, which can speed things up. But in this case, the data is just integers, so maybe it's not necessary. 

Wait, the printf statement is using %dx%d=%d\n. That's a printf statement that breaks down the numbers into their digits. So, for each (i+1, j+1), it's printing i+1 as a two-digit number, j+1 as a two-digit number, and their product as a single digit. 

In CUDA, each printf statement is executed in a separate thread. So, for each (i+1, j+1), we need to print two digits for i+1 and j+1, and one digit for the product. 

But how do I handle the digits? Well, in CUDA, each thread can have its own copy of the data. So, perhaps I can create a shared memory buffer that holds the digits of i+1 and j+1, and another buffer for the product. 

Wait, but the product is (i+1)*(j+1), which is an integer. So, I can compute that once and store it in a shared memory location. 

So, the plan is:

1. Create a shared memory buffer for the digits of i+1 and j+1. Since each number is two digits, we can have two integers in shared memory. 

2. Compute the product (i+1)*(j+1) once and store it in another shared memory buffer. 

3. For each iteration of the loops, read the digits from the shared memory, print them, and write the product to the same shared memory buffer. 

But wait, in CUDA, each thread can have its own copy of the shared memory. So, I need to make sure that the shared memory is properly initialized and that each thread has its own copy. 

Let me outline the steps:

- Initialize shared memory for i+1 and j+1. Each thread will read the digits from this shared memory. 

- Compute the product
