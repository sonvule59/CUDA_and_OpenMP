The above code is a 2D loop with i and j, and for each iteration, it calculates a and b, then prints a and b and their product.

The output is 81 lines, each with two integers and a %d and %d, and a %d.

The output is 81 lines, each with two integers and a %d and %d, and a %d.

The output is 81 lines, each with two integers and a %d and %d, and a %d.

So, the code is correct.

Now, the code is to be translated into CUDA.

The output should be 81 lines, each with two integers and a %d and %d, and a %d.

So, the code is correct.
