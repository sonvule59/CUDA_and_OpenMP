    for(int i=1;i<10;i++){
        for(int j=1;j<10;j++){

}

Wait, the original code is a loop that prints i*j as a product of two digits, each on a separate line. The CUDA code needs to replicate this functionality but using CUDA's parallel processing capabilities.

So, the main difference is that in the original code, each iteration of the loop prints a single line with two numbers. In CUDA, each iteration can print multiple lines at once, which is more efficient.

Therefore, the CUDA code should have a loop that, for each (i,j), prints multiple lines, each with the product i*j.

So, the CUDA code should have a loop similar to the main loop, but with a nested loop that for each (i,j), loops over the number of lines to print (which is 2 in this case) and for each line, calls printf with the appropriate format.

So, the CUDA code would have a loop for i from 1 to 10, and for each i, a loop for j from 1 to 10, and inside that, a loop for k from 0 to 1 (since we need two lines), and then call printf with the appropriate format.

So, the CUDA code would look like:

for (i=1; i<10; i++) {
    for (j=1; j<10; j++) {
        for (k=0; k<2; k++) {
            printf("%dx%d=%d\n", i, j, i*j);
        }
    }
}

But wait, in the original code, the printf is on a single line, but in the CUDA code, each line is printed on a separate line. So, the format string is correct.

But in the original code, the printf is followed by a newline, but in the CUDA code, each line is printed on a separate line, so the format string is correct.

So, the CUDA code should have the same structure as the main code, but with nested loops and the appropriate printf calls.

So, the final CUDA code would be:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
        for (j = 1; j
