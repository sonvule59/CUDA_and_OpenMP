The problem is that the C++ code is not valid. The CUDA code is not valid either. So, the user is asking for the translation of the C++ code to CUDA. But the user says that the C++ code is not valid and the CUDA code is not valid. So, the user is asking for the translation of the C++ code to CUDA. But the user says that the C++ code is not valid and the CUDA code is not valid. So, the user is asking for the translation of the C++ code to CUDA.
