__global__ void my CUDA code (int m, int n) { ... }

But wait, the code is not correct. It's not handling the case where m and n are both 10. So, you need to modify the code to handle that case.

So, you need to modify the code to add 1 to m and n, but only if m and n are both 10. Otherwise, increment m and n normally.

So, the code should be modified as follows:

if (m == 10 && n == 10) {
  m = m + 1;
  n = n + 1;
} else {
  m++;
  n++;
}

But wait, in the original code, m and n are being incremented in a loop. So, perhaps the CUDA code needs to handle this differently.

Wait, the original code is a loop that increments n each time, and m is incremented only when n reaches 10. So, perhaps the CUDA code needs to handle this in a way that when both m and n are 10, it increments both, otherwise, it just increments m.

But I'm not sure how to structure this in CUDA. Maybe I should think about the steps:

1. Check if m and n are both 10. If yes, then m and n are incremented by 1.

2. Else, increment m and n by 1.

So, in the CUDA code, I need to write a kernel that does this.

But wait, the original code is a loop that runs until n reaches 10, but in the CUDA code, perhaps the loop is not needed, and instead, the code can be written in a way that handles the case where both m and n are 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the CUDA code can be written as a loop that runs until m or n reaches 10, but in the case where both are 10, it increments both.

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to write a loop that runs while m < 10 or n < 10, but in the case where both are 10, it increments both.
