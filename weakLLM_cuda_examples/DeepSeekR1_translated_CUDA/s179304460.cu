Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the structure.

The code is a 2D loop, so in CUDA, it's similar to a 2D grid. So, the loop variables i and j can be mapped to the grid's x and y coordinates.

But wait, in CUDA, the grid is determined by the number of blocks and the size of each block. So, the first dimension is the number of blocks, and the second is the size per block.

So, for a 9x9 grid, the number of blocks is 9, and each block has 9 elements.

So, in the CUDA code, the loop would be:

for (int block = 0; block < 9; block++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        // access data from block, i
    }
}

But wait, in CUDA, the loop variables are mapped to the grid's x and y coordinates. So, the first loop is the x-coordinate, and the second is the y-coordinate.

So, in the CUDA code, the outer loop is for the x-coordinate, and the inner loop is for the y-coordinate.

So, the code would be:

for (int block = 0; block < 9; block++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        __global__ << i;
    }
}

But wait, in CUDA, the << operator is used to map the global ID to the local ID. So, the << i would map the global ID to the local ID i.

But in the original code, the variables are i and j, which are the loop variables. So, in the CUDA code, the loop variables i and j would be mapped to the grid's x and y coordinates.

So, the first loop is for the x-coordinate, and the second is for the y-coordinate.

So, the code would be:

for (int block = 0; block < 9; block++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        __global__ << i;
    }
}

But wait, in the original code, the variables are i and j, which are the loop variables. So, in the CUDA code, the loop variables i and j would be mapped to the grid's x and y coordinates.

So, the first loop
