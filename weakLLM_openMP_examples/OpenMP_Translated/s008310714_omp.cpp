### Explanation:
1. **Nested Loops**: The code uses two nested `for` loops. The outer loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 8, and the inner loop iterates over `n` from 0 to 8.
2. **Parallelization**: OpenMP allows us to parallelize these loops. The outer loop remains sequential, while the inner loop can be parallelized using the `parallel` keyword in OpenMP.
3. **Vectorization**: The operations inside the inner loop (multiplication and string concatenation) can be vectorized for better performance, but this is beyond the scope of basic OpenMP translation.
4. **Output**: The formatted string is printed using `std::cout`, which can be vectorized for better performance.
