The OpenMP version uses the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the outer loop. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive tells the compiler to create a team of threads and distribute the iterations of the loop among them. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used in combination with the `#pragma omp for` directive to parallelize the inner loop. The `#pragma omp for` directive tells the compiler to distribute the iterations of the loop among the threads in the team.

The OpenMP version of the code is more efficient than the C++ version because it uses multiple threads to execute the code in parallel. The OpenMP version of the code is also more readable because it uses the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the outer loop.
