// CUDA code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	for (int i = 0; i < 81; i++) {
		cout << i / 9 + 1 << "x" << i % 9 + 1 << "=" << (i/9+1)*(i%9+1) << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}

Wait, but the code is not using CUDA syntax. So, I need to translate it into CUDA code.

First, I need to make sure that the code is compatible with CUDA. CUDA requires that the code is written in C and uses CUDA syntax, which includes functions like __setubenius, __global__ variables, and __shared__ variables.

In the original code, the code is using for loops, which are not CUDA compatible. So, I need to replace the for loops with CUDA's loop constructs.

In CUDA, the main loop is replaced with __global__ for loops. So, I can use __global__ for i = 0 to 80.

But wait, in CUDA, the loop variable is __global__ i, which is a pointer to an integer. So, I need to make sure that the code is compatible with the device.

Also, the code uses cout, which is a CUDA extension. So, I can use __cout__.

But in the original code, the code is using cout, which is a C extension. So, in CUDA, I can use __cout__.

So, I can replace the cout statements with __cout__.

Also, the code uses i / 9 and i % 9, which are integer divisions. So, in CUDA, I can use the same operations.

So, the code can be translated as follows:

First, include the necessary headers. Since CUDA code is written in C, I need to include <iostream> and <cuda.h> for CUDA functions.

But in the original code, the include is <iostream>, so I can keep that.

Then, the main function is replaced with __global__ main().

But in CUDA, the main function is not needed, so I can have a void main() function.

Then, the loop is replaced with __global__ for (int i = 0; i < 81; i++).

But wait, in CUDA, the loop variable is __global__ i, which is a pointer to an integer. So, I need to make sure that the device has enough
