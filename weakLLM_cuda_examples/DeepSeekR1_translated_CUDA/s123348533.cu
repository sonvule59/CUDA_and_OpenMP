// CUDA code
//----------------------------------------------------

So, I need to translate this C++ code into CUDA, but only return the CUDA .cu code, no markdown or explanations. So, I need to make sure that the code compiles and runs correctly on CUDA-enabled GPUs.

Okay, let's start by understanding the original code.

The main function initializes a loop from 1 to 9 for both i and j, then prints i x j = i*j.

In CUDA, we can't directly loop like that because CUDA is parallel and each thread would have to handle a single i and j. But wait, in this case, the output is a simple multiplication table, so maybe we can generate the data on the GPU and then write it to the output device.

So, the plan is:

1. Generate all the i and j values on the GPU.
2. Compute the product i*j for each pair.
3. Write the results to the output device.

But how to do this in CUDA?

First, I need to create a device buffer for the output. Since the output is a 9x9 table, each line has 9 numbers. So, the output device needs to have 9 elements per line, and 9 lines.

In CUDA, the device buffer can be created using the deviceCreate function. So, I'll create a buffer for the output device.

Then, I'll create a device buffer for the input data. Since each thread will need to read a value from the input vector, I'll create a vector of ll (int64_t) with 81 elements (9x9). Then, I'll copy this vector to the device memory.

Next, I'll create a device buffer for the output data. This buffer will have the same dimensions as the output device buffer, but it will store the computed products.

Then, I'll copy the input data to the device memory, perform the multiplication, and copy the results back to the output device memory.

Finally, I'll transfer the output data from the device memory back to the CPU, and then print it.

Wait, but in CUDA, the output device is separate from the input device. So, I need to make sure that the output device is created before the input data is copied.

So, the steps in code would be:

- Create the output device buffer.
- Create the input vector, copy it to the input device buffer.
- Create the output vector, copy it to the output device buffer.
- Perform the multiplication on the input vector and
