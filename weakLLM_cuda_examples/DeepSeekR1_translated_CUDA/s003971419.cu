Your code should be a CUDA .cu file, which is a translation of the code above into CUDA. Your code should be a translation of the code above into CUDA. Your code should be a translation of the code above into CUDA. Your code should be a translation of the code above into CUDA.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The user provided a C++ code snippet and wants it translated into CUDA. But the code is in C++, and the assistant is supposed to write CUDA code. So perhaps the user wants to know how to convert a C++ program into CUDA, but the assistant is supposed to write the CUDA code.

Wait, the user wrote: "Translate the following C++ code into valid CUDA. Return only CUDA `.cu` code, no markdown or explanations."

So the task is to take the given C++ code and write a CUDA .cu code that is a translation of it.

But the given C++ code is a loop that writes to a file, each line being i x j = i*j.

So the C++ code is:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<ll, ll> P;

#define EACH(i,a) for (auto& i : a)
#define FOR(i,a,b) for (ll i=(a);i<(b);i++)
#define RFOR(i,a,b) for (ll i=(b)-1;i>=(a);i--)
#define REP(i,n) for (ll i=0;i<(n);i++)
#define RREP(i,n) for (ll i=(n)-1;i>=0;i--)
#define debug(x) cout<<#x<<": "<<x<<endl
#define pb push_back
#define ALL(a) (a).begin(),(a).end()

const ll linf = 1e18;
const int inf = 1e9;
const double eps = 1e-12;
const double pi = acos(-1);

template<typename T>
istream& operator>>(istream& is, vector<T>& vec) {
	EACH(x,vec) is >> x;
	return is;
}
template<typename T>
ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, vector<T>& vec) {
	REP(i,vec.size()) {
		if (i) os << " ";
		os << vec[i];
	}
	return os;
}
template<typename T>
ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, vector< vector<T> >& vec)
