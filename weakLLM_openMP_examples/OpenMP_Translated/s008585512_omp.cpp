I'm supposed to write a code that uses OpenMP for parallelization. The code I have is a C++ program that reads from standard input, constructs a map, and outputs some information. The program is supposed to be efficient, but I'm not sure how to translate it into OpenMP. I need to focus on parallel loops or sections. The output should be valid code only with no markdown or explanation.

I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Maybe I should start by identifying the parts of the code that can be parallelized. The main loop is a double loop over i and j, each ranging from 1 to 9. The map is constructed in a nested loop, and then output in a single line.

So, the first step is to identify which loops can be parallelized. The double loop over i and j is definitely a candidate for OpenMP. OpenMP typically uses the for_each or parallel_for directives, but in this case, since it's a double loop, we can use the parallel_for directive for each loop.

Wait, but in C++, OpenMP's parallel_for can be used for each loop. So, perhaps we can use two parallel_for loops, one for i and one for j, each running from 1 to 9. Then, for each i and j, we can perform the map operation.

Alternatively, since the loops are nested, we can use a single parallel_for loop that iterates over both i and j. But I'm not sure if that's feasible. Maybe it's better to use two separate parallel_for loops for each loop.

So, the plan is:

1. Replace the for loops with parallel_for loops for i and j.

2. Inside each loop, perform the map operation.

3. Then, output the result.

But wait, the output is a single line, which is a bit tricky because OpenMP doesn't directly support parallel output. So, perhaps we can collect all the output lines in a way that they can be written to a file or a stream in parallel.

Alternatively, since the output is a single line, perhaps we can write all the lines to a file in parallel. But that might not be efficient, as each line is written sequentially.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to collect all the output lines and write them to a file in parallel. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since the output is a single line, perhaps we can write all the lines to a stream in parallel. But that might not be feasible because each line is written sequentially.

Wait, perhaps the output can be written to a file, and then the file can be written in parallel. But that would require writing to a file, which is not directly supported in OpenMP.
