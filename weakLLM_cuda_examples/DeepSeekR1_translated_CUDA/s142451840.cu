Wait, but in CUDA, variables are stored in shared memory, not in the global memory. So, the code above is incorrect because it's trying to modify the global memory, which is not allowed in CUDA. Instead, the variables x and y should be stored in shared memory.

So, the correct approach is to have x and y be in shared memory, and then use the shared memory's value in the printf statement.

So, the code should be:

__shared__ int x, y;

for(i=0; i<9; i++){
	x = __shared__ x;
	y = __shared__ y;
	++x;
	++y;
	printf("%dx%d=%d\n",x,y,x*y);
};
}

Wait, but in the original code, the variables x and y are being modified in the loop. So, in the CUDA code, we need to make sure that the shared memory is correctly accessed.

So, the code should be:

__shared__ int x, y;

for(i=0; i<9; i++){
	x = __shared__ x;
	y = __shared__ y;
	++x;
	++y;
	printf("%dx%d=%d\n",x,y,x*y);
};
}
