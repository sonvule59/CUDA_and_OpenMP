Explanation:
- The original C++ code is a simple nested loop that computes the product of two numbers `i` and `j`. It uses the `cout` statement to print the results.
- In the CUDA code, we define a kernel function called `matrixMultiplicationKernel` with three arguments: `n`, `m`, and `A`, which represent the number of rows and columns in the matrices, and `A` and `B`, which represent the matrices themselves.
- Inside the kernel function, we use the `__global__` directive to indicate that this kernel should be executed on a GPU thread block. We also specify the dimensions of the grid (`blockDim.x` and `blockDim.y`) and the thread index (`threadIdx.x` and `threadIdx.y`).
- The first line of the kernel function checks if the current thread index is within the range of the matrices (`row >= n` and `col >= m`). If so, it extracts the row and column indices using `gridIndex.x` and `gridIndex.y`.
- Next, it initializes a variable `sum` to store the product of `A` and `B`. This is done using a `for` loop that iterates over each element in `A` and `B`.
- After that, it enters a `for` loop that iterates over each element in `A` and `B` at the same time. For each pair of elements, it adds their corresponding values in `A` and `B` and stores the result in the `sum` variable.
- Finally
